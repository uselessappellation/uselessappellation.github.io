            <p class="desc">You can call me Useless. Or, if you feel bad doing that, then "Uselessapp", "App", whatever else, is fine as well.</p>

            <p class="desc">I'm an aspiring artist, occasional Vtuber, and design graduate. My illustrations tend to focus on character art; mostly, I do pencil sketches and digital works. I also enjoy some crafts, including paper craft and crochet.</p>

            <p class="desc">That's tea in the pic, because I quite enjoy tea (unsweetened oolong with light ice is where it's at).</p>

            <p class="desc">Curious about the logo? Used the @ symbol as it usually pertains to a username, and added a strike-through to mean the uselessness of it (or the theoretical uselessness, ironically I've stuck to this username more than any other I've made lol).</p>
